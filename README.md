# Tomás Aguirre - Personal Website

This is my personal academic website where I share my work in economics, artificial intelligence, and public policy.

## About Me

I'm an Economics undergraduate at the University of São Paulo (USP) with research interests at the intersection of economics, artificial intelligence, and public policy. Currently, I serve as a Research Assistant at the Centre for the Governance of AI, working on AI-induced job displacement in the US.

My research contributions include a chapter for NBER's Economics of Transformative AI volume and work on industry dynamics in frontier AI development in my paper "On Labs and Fabs."
