# Hello, I'm Tomás Aguirre

I'm an Economics undergraduate at the University of São Paulo (USP) with research interests at the intersection of economics, artificial intelligence, and public policy. 

I aim to contribute to our understanding of how AI technologies reshape economic systems and labor markets.

## Current Work
I'm a Research Assistant at the Centre for the Governance of AI, working with Sam Manning on AI-induced job displacement in the US, and will join their Summer Fellowship in London.

My contributions include a chapter for NBER's Economics of Transformative AI volume and collaborative research on reproducibility under review at Nature. I'm also studying industry dynamics in frontier AI development in my paper "On Labs and Fabs."

## Background
My previous research spans economic history, industrial organization, and quantitative finance. I'm an International Economics Olympiad silver medalist and former team leader for Brazil's world champion team. I've been selected for Stanford University's Economics of Transformative AI summer course.

I work with Python, R, and C/C++, applying data science frameworks to economic research.

Feel free to explore my [publications](/publications/), [CV](/cv/), or contact me at [t6aguirre@gmail.com](mailto:t6aguirre@gmail.com).
