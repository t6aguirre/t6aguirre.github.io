# Hello, I'm Tomás Aguirre

I'm an Economics undergraduate at the University of São Paulo (USP). My research interests span the intersection of economics, artificial intelligence, and public policy.

## Research Interests

In the long term, I hope to contribute to our understanding of how AI technologies are reshaping economic systems and labor markets. Currently, I'm exploring several areas that include:

- **AI governance and policy**: Analyzing institutional frameworks and policy approaches for managing advanced AI systems
- **Labor market impacts**: Studying AI-induced job displacement and developing metrics to evaluate vulnerability across occupations
- **AI supply chains**: Examining the industrial organization of frontier AI companies and semiconductor manufacturers
- **Misinformation dynamics**: Investigating how information spreads in digital networks, with a focus on polarization and extremism

## Current Work

I currently serve as a Research Assistant at the Centre for the Governance of AI, working with Sam Manning on analyzing AI-induced job displacement in the US. I'm also preparing to join their Summer Fellowship program in London.

I've had the opportunity to contribute to research in various contexts, including a chapter for NBER's Economics of Transformative AI volume and collaborative work on research reproducibility currently under review at Nature. I've also been exploring how industry dynamics shape frontier AI development in my paper "On Labs and Fabs."

## Background

Before focusing on AI economics, I worked on various research projects in economic history, industrial organization, and quantitative finance. I'm an alumnus of the International Economics Olympiad (silver medalist and later team leader for Brazil's world champion team) and have been selected to participate in Stanford University's upcoming Economics of Transformative AI summer course.

I work with Python, R, and C/C++, applying these tools alongside various data science frameworks to approach research question

I'm open to collaboration and discussion across various fields in economics and data science. Feel free to explore my [publications](/publications/), [CV](/cv/), or reach out at [t6aguirre@gmail.com](mailto:t6aguirre@gmail.com) if you'd like to connect.
