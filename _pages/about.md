Hi, I'm Tomás! I'm an Economics undergraduate at the University of São Paulo (USP) and a Research Assistant at the Centre for the Governance of AI. My research interests lie at the intersection of economics, artificial intelligence, and public policy. 

I aim to contribute to our understanding of how AI technologies reshape economic systems and labor markets. Check out my [CV](https://t6aguirre.github.io/files/tomas_aguirre_cv_2025_04_14.pdf) for more details about my work.

## Current Work
At the Centre for the Governance of AI, I work with Sam Manning on AI-induced job displacement in the US, and will join their Summer Fellowship in London.

My contributions include an upcoming chapter for NBER's Economics of Transformative AI volume and colabarating on research on reproducibility under review at Nature. 

I've been also working on projects related to opinion dynamics in social networks, building on my past work as an engineer at the Brazilian startup Palver. 

## Background
My previous research spans economic history, industrial organization, and quantitative finance. I'm an International Economics Olympiad medalist and former team leader for Brazil's world champion team. I've been selected for Stanford University's Economics of Transformative AI summer course.

I work with Python and R, applying data science frameworks to economic research.
