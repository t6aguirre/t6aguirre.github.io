# Hello, I'm Tomás Aguirre

I'm an Economics undergraduate at the University of São Paulo (USP), where I'm ranked 1st in my cohort. My research focuses on the intersection of economics, artificial intelligence, and public policy.

## Research Interests

My work explores how AI technologies are reshaping economic systems and labor markets. I'm particularly interested in:

- **AI governance and policy**: Analyzing institutional frameworks and policy approaches for managing advanced AI systems
- **Labor market impacts**: Studying AI-induced job displacement and developing metrics to evaluate vulnerability across occupations
- **AI supply chains**: Examining the industrial organization of frontier AI companies and semiconductor manufacturers
- **Misinformation dynamics**: Investigating how information spreads in digital networks, with a focus on polarization and extremism

## Current Work

I currently serve as a Research Assistant at the Centre for the Governance of AI, working with Sam Manning on analyzing AI-induced job displacement in the US. I'm also preparing to join their Summer Fellowship program in London.

My recent research includes a forthcoming chapter in NBER's Economics of Transformative AI volume and a paper on research reproducibility under review at Nature. As the sole author of "On Labs and Fabs," I've also explored how alliances, acquisitions, and antitrust regulation are shaping the frontier AI industry.

## Background

Before focusing on AI economics, I worked on various research projects in economic history, industrial organization, and quantitative finance. I'm an alumnus of the International Economics Olympiad (silver medalist and later team leader for Brazil's world champion team) and have been selected to participate in Stanford University's upcoming Economics of Transformative AI summer course.

I'm proficient in Python, R, and C/C++, with extensive experience in AI and data science tools including PyTorch, Pandas, and scikit-learn.

Feel free to explore my [publications](/publications/), [CV](/cv/), or contact me directly at [t6aguirre@gmail.com](mailto:t6aguirre@gmail.com).
